# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)

I'm working through the classic computer science text SICP. The book's examples are given in the Lisp dialect, Scheme, which I don't know. But I do know Clojure, and I thought this would be an excellent opportunity to learn some programming language theory and have fun writing some Clojure at the same time.
